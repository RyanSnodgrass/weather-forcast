# README

I generated this with my own [rails template](https://github.com/RyanSnodgrass/personal-rails-template). It's something I picked up from my previous employer. It installs a couple gems that I always use like linters and github workflows.

## Setup

```
bundle install
bundle exec rails s
```

### Requirements
Ruby 3.1.3
PostgreSQL

### Weather API
Sign up for free at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and grab your API key. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your key in there.
